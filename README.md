## Introduction

Jamil my friend came up with the idea of this project when i went to him about my ALX program project. He told me about the idea of bnb the website where you rent your home for a short period of time and it will be wonderful to have a site where you can rent office space. We talk about the idea for hours, we talked about it, if it is existing before now then we realise it is existing but on Country level and in UK only, base on our research. Implementation, planning of the site pages and looks of the site kicked in. Furthermore we also realise that it could fix space issues in TECH world because developers alway find it difficult to assemble a team and get them in a location to work on a project and logged out when done without spending much on space and all that goes with getting a space. We then came up with the idea and plan to build a site  of Work AnyWhere.
